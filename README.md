# UFC Fantasy WordPress Theme

## Next top milestones

* Auto generate post on "Add Event"
* Include ACF in theme
* Store fighter/fight/event JSON in it's own databases (or the necessary key/value pairs) to limit API calls.
  * Need to check for when events/fights/fighters change
  * This may not be possible if there is no date modified object
* Only constant API call should be for news on main page.  Everything else should call from a database.
* ~~Admin panel - Add event only for the current days event or future instead of all pas, present, and future fights~~

## To do

* If fight is pulled, remove it from picks page, picks db, bets db, etc
* Refactor code
* Improve page speed and performance
* Lots of other stuff

## Installation
